# Hacker News Re-Skin

Creating a version of HN that shows the top stories in a more visually appealing way.

![in action](in_action.gif)

Key features:

- Get the top stories from Hacker News every hour
- Use AI to summarize the stories
- Display the stories in a visually appealing way (including an image for each story if available)

The styling is currently quite minimal - we encourage you to make your own crazy-looking versions!
