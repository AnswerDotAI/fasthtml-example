    "# FastHTML By Example\n",
    "\n",
    "FastHTML is \"a library for writing fast and scalable Starlette-powered web applications\". The [docs](https://answerdotai.github.io/fasthtml/) show the basic usage, but there are lots of non-FastHTML-specific tricks and patterns involved in building web apps. The goal of this tutorial is to give an alternate introduction to FastHTML, building out a number of example applications to show common patterns and illustrate some of the ways you can build on top of the FastHTML foundations to create your own custom web apps. A secondary goal is to have this be a useful document to add to the context of an LLM to turn it into a useful FastHTML assistant - in fact, in some of the examples we'll see this kind of assistant in action, thanks to [this custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-xPqF9SZjM-fasthtml-helper) I made.\n",

    "Plain HTML probably isn't quite what you imagine when you visualize your beautiful web app. CSS is the go-to language for styling HTML. But again, we don't want to learn extra languages unless we absolutely have to! Fortunately, there are ways to get much more visually appealing sites by relying on the hard work of others, using existing CSS libraries. One of our favourites is [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/). To add a CSS file to HTML, you can use the `<link>` tag. Since we typically want things like CSS styling on all pages of our app, FastHTML lets you add shared headers when you define your app. And it already has `picolink` defined for convenience. As per the [pico docs](https://picocss.com/docs), we put all of our content inside a `<main>` tag with a class of `container`: \n"

Attributes are passed in as keywords. `class` and `for` are special words in python, so we use `cls`, `klass` or `_class` instead of `class` and `fr` or `_for` instead of `for`. Note these objects are just 3-element lists - you can create custom ones too as long as they're also 3-element lists. Alternately, leaf nodes can be strings instead (which is why you can do `Div('some text')`). If you pass something that isn't a 3-element list or a string, it will be converted to a string using str()... unless (our final trick) you define a `__xt__` method that will run before str(), so you can render things a custom way.\n",
