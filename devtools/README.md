# com.chrome.devtools.json demo

See [this page](https://chromium.googlesource.com/devtools/devtools-frontend/+/main/docs/ecosystem/automatic_workspace_folders.md) for instructions on ensuring your version of Chrome is set up correctly, and [this documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces) to learn about using workspaces in general.

Once you've run `app.devtools_json()` you should be able to go to the workspaces tab in Chrome for your app (if it's running on localhost) and see an option to auto-connect the workspace.
