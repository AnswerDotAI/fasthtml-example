    "### Authentication, OpenID, and OAuth\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder, why are we talking about OpenID rather than OAuth? Or vice versa?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenID provides authentication. But it's built on the more general foundation of OAuth, so to use it you end up using OAuth configuration pages, libraries, and jargon. This creates enough moving pieces that, if you want to understand OpenID, you need to bite the bullet and learn the OAuth lingo. In particular, OAuth describes four roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Resource Owner (aka, the end-user).\n",
    "   This will be a person who wants to login to our web app.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- the Client Application.\n",
    "  This will be our web app, which will be implemented by `server.py`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- the Authorization Server.\n",
    "  This will be a server which dispenses _authorization codes_, _refresh tokens_, and _access tokens_. In this example, it will be Google's servers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- the Resource Server.\n",
    "  This will be a server which provides access to _resources_, when it is given an appropriate _access token_.  In this example this will also be Google's servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are not accessing a _material resource_ like a Google Doc. We are only using Google as an identity provider, to enable users to login with their gmail account. So in this case, the resource is user identity information, such as a numerical Google Account ID, but also possibly other profile information like the user's name and email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the miminal use of OAuth which is at work whenever you use Google just for login (\"Sign-in with Google\"). This use of OAuth is what is described and refined by OpenID Connect. This is why, although we are only using Google for login (with OpenID), we get stated by setting up OAuth configurations."

    "## Configuring your app's Google Cloud OAuth configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "First you need to configure a few settings in Google Cloud Console (GCC), so that Google and your app can coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're at the GCC page for your app, these are the main settings you need to configure. (Real talk: this is the most annoying part of the process.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Application type, and other settings\n",
    "\n",
    "First, define your application type as as a \"Web Application\". (OAuth works a bit differently for other application types, which we will not discuss here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also settings for a [user consent screen](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect#re-consent), which you may ignore for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Authorized Redirect URI\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, on the GCC (Google Cloud Console) page, look for the section titled \"Authorized Redirect URIs\" and for now enter the following value (take note that it is `http` not `https`!): `http://localhost:5001/redirect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explain the meaning of this value later when we show what it is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ClientID and Client Secret\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need get your application's ID. For your app (the Client) to use OAuth2 to access Google identity server (the Authorization Server), your app needs to declare and prove who it is to Google.. In other words, your app, the Client, needs to be able to authenticate _itself_ to Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a webapp, this is done by coordinating on a shared secret ahead of time -- the _Client ID_ and the _Client secret_. The client ID says who the app is, the client secret proves it. It is essentially your app's own password to Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "After clicking the down arrow to download the credits you will see a modal dialog saying \"OAuth client created\", and showing your Client ID and Client secret, and saving them to a json file. Rename that file to `creds.json`: "

    "#### Creating an Authorization Link\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose an end-user wants to login to your app using their Google account.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, they'll click your app's \"sign-in with Google\" link, an authorization link. This link will send the user to a Google page, where Google will ask them if they'd like to login to use your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In OAuth terms, this is the end-user delegating to your app the authority to know their Google account ID. Or it can be thought of as asking Google to attest that a user exists with a stable account ID.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create that authorization link. The link needs to pack in a few obvious pieces of information to tell Google:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. that the user is coming from your app (so it needs your Client ID),\n",
    "2. what permissions your app is asking for (so it needs the so-called \"scope\"),\n",
    "3. where Google should send the resulting permissions (so it needs your app's _authorized redirect URL_, where Google will send its reply indirectly by redirecting the user's browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the link also needs a fourth, less obvious piece of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. an anti-CSRF token. This is a token you give Google, just so you can check it later, to ensure that any reply from Google is _actually a reply to your specific request_. This is to protect against an attacker who tricks a user with replies to his requests. This is known as a cross-site request forgery attack, so this last piece of information is known as the anti-CSRF token, which can be a random string.\n",

    "##### Sidebar: why an \"id token\"? why not a refresh token?\n",
    "\n",
    "We got the access token from the response and used it to get user information like their ID (their `sub`) in a follow-up request. This is the classic oauth flow, where you exchange an authorization code for an access token and a refresh token, and then use the access token to access resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you might have noticed a few oddities. The original response also included an \"id token\" and omitted any refresh tokens. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is because we're not using just OAuth but OpenID, since we requested the 'openid' scope and chose Google's OpenID endpoint. The id token is an OpenID-defined value, a JWT which in fact includes the `sub`, the `hd`, and other values in our initial reply. So we didn't strictly need to use the access token for a follow up request to get those values. We did it to conform to the same flow which we would use for _other_ kinds of grants, like access to mutable resources like an API or a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the reason we did not need and therefore did not request a refresh token. Refresh tokens are for refreshing access tokens, which expire fairly quickly. For instance, this one will expire in an hour, but that does not matter because we use it immediately to get an identifier, which is guaranteed to be accurate indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we get a token which gives us short-lived access to the user's ID. But the ID does not change. In our app, the lifetime of our login session will depend not on the lifetime of that access token, but on a separate session mechanism which the app implements, using the ID simply as an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious, you can look inside the JWT ID token which we ignored, and see the familiar values and some other ones, whose meaning is defined by the [OpenID spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken)."

    "### Implementing the flow with route handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "The above implements the entire authorization code flow manually. Now let us see how the same flow looks in a FastHTML app.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two differences to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, obviously, in the above example, you manually copied and pasted the authorization URL into a browser to kick off the flow, and then manually copied and pasted the resulting redirect URL into the notebook for processing. In a web app, both those actions will be initiated by routes -- your app's _login route_ which presents the authorization URL for the user to sign-in with Google, and the _redirect route_, where the user receives the redirected browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, more subtly, in the above example it sufficed to save the anti-csrf token in a global variable. This is because we manually handled parsing the redirect URI so we knew it came from us, and because the notebook acted like a single browser session.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a web app, which must handle many users at once, we will save the anti-csrf in the session dictionary. This binds the reply delivereed via the redirect URL with the initial request to the auth servers, ensuring that a user cannot be tricked into opening a redirect URI which was a reply to a request launched from a different browser, and therefore from a different user session.\n",
