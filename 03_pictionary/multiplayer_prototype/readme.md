This isn't a finished product, and is due a refactor/re-write. Nonetheless, included here to show how one might quickly try out something a little more complex, leaning heavily on AI code assistants (I take no responsibility for the mess that is the multi-threaded guessing code). 

You can try it in action at https://ai-pictionary.up.railway.app, although I won't guarentee the drawing part will stay up since public-facng whiteboards tend towards the phallic if left public for too long.

Currently requires 3 secrets / environment variables to be set:
`G_API_KEY` for google genai api key
`AZURE_KEY` for an azure openai api key
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for claude haiku
