TODO intro

- `basic.py`: A minimal version of the app, showing the chat bubble styling as described in [this tutorial](https://fhdocs.answer.ai/by_example.html#full-example-3---chatbot-example-with-daisyui-components).
- `polling.py`: Extending the basic chatbot with a polling mechanism so that the UI updates as soon as the user sends a message, and then streams the response from the chat model.
- `websockets.py`: Extending the basic chatbot to do streaming with websockets.
