This app requires setting REPLICATE_API_KEY as a variable in the Railway project or as an environment variable for running locally.

**WARNING**: Deploying this publically will 1) let anyone see all images generated and 2) let anyone generate images (using up your replicate credits). We recommend NOT doing this!
