# Doodle Demo

This uses [Doodle CSS](https://chr15m.github.io/DoodleCSS/) to render a form in a doodle style.

The main doodle.css file and necessary extra files (SVGs of boxes etc) are downloaded from the Doodle CSS GitHub repo.
On larger projects you might organise these into a separate folder ('/static/doodle').
The Doodle CSS library and this demo are licenced under the MIT licence - a copy is included in this folder.
